abstract: "Among the most popular works in Turkish natural
language processing there are Zemberek and ITU Turkish
Natural Language Processing Pipeline. The former is an open
source software library that consists of various natural language
processing components whereas the latter provides an online user
interface, yet not open source. In this study, we present an online
user interface for Turkish Nlptoolkit, which is another Turkish
natural language processing tool. Thanks to this interface, it is
possible to use asciifier, deasciifier, tokenizer, sentence splitter,
morphological analyzer/disambiguator components of Nlptoolkit
online."
